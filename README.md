Written by: Aarthi Sivasankar
PA03 consists of a Course Finder/Schedule Builder App built through Javascript. Models, routes and views are utilizied such that the program uses a mongoose database with the Courses, Schedule, Todoitem, and User tables to allow users to log into the webapp, browse through the course catalog and build their class schedule as they wish.

In order to download and install the app, first, you will need to clone the git repo to your desktop or whichever location you would like. Then, in the terminal, run npm install. This allows us to download all packages and dependecies as needed to run the program. Finally running npm start script command in the terminal execures the program on the specified localhost port number.

After running npm install and npm start on the terminal, typing localhost:5000 inn your browser will now take you to the running webapp!
